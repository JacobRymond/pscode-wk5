// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd



Ask for a number
If the number divided by 2 has no remainder 
Print even
Else 
Print odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Ask for 5 numbers
Separate all numbers into distinct variables
Add all 5 numbers
Divide the sum of all numbers by 5 for the average and put into variable average 
If num1 > num2
 Num 1 = max
else num2 = max
If max > num3
Max = max
else
Max = num3
If max > num4
Max = max
Else max = num4
If max > num5
Max = max
else: max = num5
Repeat the process for minimum 
then print "The average number is:" + average
Print "the largest number is" + max
Print "the smallest number is" + min
